		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<div><p class = "Bio">I was born and brought up in New England with my mother, father, and two brothers.  I am currently majoring in Computer Science, as well as fulfilling the pre-med requirements.  In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing tennis, and spending time outside.</p></div>

		<div><p class = "Bio">My other interests include traveling with my family and cooking.  I enjoy learning about new cultures and finding new things to try.  At school, I participate in club tennis, and am also a member of the Bhangra team.  I volunteer with my friends once a week with a group that reads to young children.  During the week, most of my time is devoted to school work, but on the weekends, I normally like to explore the surrounding city with friends.</p></div>

		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<div><p class = "Bio">I was born and brought up in Connecticut with my mother, father, and two brothers.  I am currently majoring in Computer Science and aspire to combine compsci and the medical field.  In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing tennis, and spending time outside.</p></div>

		<div><p class = "Bio">At school, I spend most of my free time playing tennis on the club team.  I am also a member of the Bhangra team and a volunteer group that reads to children.  During the week, most of my time is devoted to school work, but on the weekend, I normally like to explore the surrounding city with friends.</p></div>
